# AI Gamification Projects

## Project 1 – AI Gamification Tool

**Goal:** Build an AI‑powered gamification tool that uses a cleaned dataset to recommend or generate engaging gamified activities (e.g., challenges, badges) for a particular domain. Students will work from dataset preparation through to an operational tool.

| Month | Deliverable | Description & rationale |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **September – Cleaned data & AI framework** | **Tangible deliverable:** dataset cleaned and an initial AI framework (e.g., model structure and repository). | Students gather data and perform a thorough cleaning. They should remove duplicates, handle missing values and standardize formats—data cleaning is critical for accurate analysis and prevents biased AI results. They then define the problem and user needs, sketch gamification tasks, and set up a base model architecture. |
| **October – Working AI prototype** | **Deliverable:** functional prototype of the AI tool. | Using an iterative design approach (define→ideate→prototype→test→evaluate), students build a minimum viable prototype, test with peers/users, and refine it. The prototype should demonstrate core gamification features (e.g., recommending challenges based on user data). |
| **November – Fully functional AI tool** | **Deliverable:** complete AI gamification tool with user interface and basic documentation. | After incorporating feedback, the team finalizes the tool and ensures the AI recommendations work consistently. A brief user test will confirm reliability. |
