# AI Gamification Projects

## Project 1 – AI Gamification Tool

**Goal:** Build an AI‑powered gamification tool that uses a cleaned dataset to recommend or generate engaging gamified activities (e.g., challenges, badges) for a particular domain. Students will work from dataset preparation through to an operational tool.

| Month | Deliverable | Description & rationale |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **September – Cleaned data & AI framework** | **Tangible deliverable:** dataset cleaned and an initial AI framework (e.g., model structure and repository). | Students gather data and perform a thorough cleaning. They should remove duplicates, handle missing values and standardize formats—data cleaning is critical for accurate analysis and prevents biased AI results. They then define the problem and user needs, sketch gamification tasks, and set up a base model architecture. |
| **October – Working AI prototype** | **Deliverable:** functional prototype of the AI tool. | Using an iterative design approach (define→ideate→prototype→test→evaluate), students build a minimum viable prototype, test with peers/users, and refine it. The prototype should demonstrate core gamification features (e.g., recommending challenges based on user data). |
| **November – Fully functional AI tool** | **Deliverable:** complete AI gamification tool with user interface and basic documentation. | After incorporating feedback, the team finalizes the tool and ensures the AI recommendations work consistently. A brief user test will confirm reliability. |

## Project 2 – Gamification Documentation

**Goal:** Produce comprehensive documentation for the AI gamification tool, enabling others to understand, deploy and maintain it. Students will also design and administer a user feedback survey to validate the documentation's clarity.

| Month | Deliverable | Description & rationale |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **September – Draft outline** | **Deliverable:** structured outline for the documentation. | Students identify the target audience and goals of the documentation, define the scope, and develop a content strategy. Effective documentation requires understanding user needs and creating a style guide with consistent tone and terminology. |
| **October – Polished documentation** | **Deliverable:** complete documentation draft (installation, usage, API reference, gamification logic) tested by peers. | Write clear, concise sections using simple language and examples. Include diagrams and code snippets; review and revise with team members and technical leads to ensure accuracy and maintainability. |
| **November – Final documentation & user feedback survey** | **Deliverables:** finalised documentation and results from a brief user survey. | Conduct a user feedback survey to evaluate the clarity of the documentation. Surveys should have a specific goal, remain short (ideally under 10 minutes), use mostly closed‑ended questions for reliable data and avoid leading or biased wording. Provide a modest incentive if appropriate to encourage participation. Summarize survey results and incorporate feedback into the final doc. |
